# PyBer_Analysis
Matplotlib: Visualization tools.

## Overview of the analysis
PyBer is a Python based ride-sharing app company that is conducting an exploratory analysis on data with the purpose of drawing conclusions that generate insights, drive positive change and  influence business. In order to help stakeholders meet their goals we will analyze all the rideshare data from January to April of 2019, the objective is to assist PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

For this project we want to present a compelling story about the data as well as create a multilinear chart that  showcases the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. To accomplish our objective we will use the Python graphic library Matpltlib to produce visualizations that allow stakeholders to identify opportunities for growth.

## Results
This analysis focused on the first quarter of 2019 where PyBer provided rideshare services to cities that were classified into urban, suburban and rural to describe the differences in data among the different city types. The following data frame represents a summary of rideshare data from January through May 2019. The table reflects how urban, suburban and rural cities average fare per ride and average fare per driver relate to the size of the community. Urban cities have 13 times more drivers than rural cities, which has a direct impact on the price range being three times higher in rural cities.

The next table is a summary of revenue generated by each type of city where the data is analyzed by weeks and provides an overview that allows us to compare each type of city service performance.

To make our fundings more visual we have created a graph that reflects the total fare by city type. The multilinear graph helps to communicate the patterns among cities, where the lack of drivers affects prices and in consequence it affects the number of riders.

###  Total weekly fares for each city type.

## Summary
This report has been shared with the CEO and stakeholders to help them make decisions about which types of cities need more driver support and to close the gap between urban and rural rideshare services we would recommend the following practices.

1. Create an initiative that promotes rideshare jobs to increase the number of drivers in rural cities.  An example could be letting drivers see a potential ride's destination and how much that trip will pay before accepting it, as well as different ways they can be paid for their work. 
2. To keep communities connected PyBer could introduce other types of rideshare to rural cities. For example bike or scooter sharing that have proved in other types of cities to be reliable  transportation. 
3. Offer discounted car rides. Low income communities would benefit from discounted car rides just to do basic errands like going to grocery stores or attending medical appointments.
